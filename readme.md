# SCA-GWO Hybrid Missing Value Imputation  

A Python implementation of a hybrid optimization approach for imputing missing values in datasets, combining the **Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA)** and **Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)**.  

## Overview  
1. **SCA Phase**: Uses Sine Cosine Algorithm to initially impute missing values and explores solution.
2. **GWO Phase**: Takes SCA-imputed values as input and re-evaluates it Grey Wolf Optimizer to the most accurate predictions based on fitness function.
 

## Usage  
check ```sca.py``` and you can start to work on it. you can also find the dataset ```water_potability.csv```.   

## Madjour amir

- My code is prepared for direct integration with code, you only call the function with data from ```water_potability.csv```

## Good Luck habayebna !
